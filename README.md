# ChefDeprecations

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/chef_deprecations.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/chef_deprecations)

This is a simple gem that allows us to replace deprecated binaries in Chef Workstation with binaries that throw proper warning messages. This way we can remove legacy commands in a more friendly way.
